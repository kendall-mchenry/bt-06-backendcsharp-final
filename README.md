# bt-06-backendcsharp-final

*All repositories starting with "bt" are midterm or final projects for my 39-week Full Stack Web Development bootcamp through Bethel School of Technology.*

This was the final project for 6-week Backend Frameworks (C#/.NET) course using Angular and C#/.NET.

A full-stack social app where Users can register and create Posts, using: 
1) An authenticated .NET REST API as the backend 
2) Data persistence using a SQL database 
3) A front-end Angular that makes requests to the API and renders the data to the user

Focus was on building out all connections, components, and basic authentication. Less focus was on styling or more advanced features.

*My final grade on this project was 400/400.* :100:	:tada:
